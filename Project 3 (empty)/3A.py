Project 3A: 
Develop a program that converts feet to inches. 
Your program should ask the user for number of feet and then outputs the converted number of inches. 
In your program, make a function named "feet_to_inches" that accepts number of feet as an argument and 
returns the number of inches in that many feet (ex: 2 feet should return 24 inches). 

Programmer: Horsman, Kenneth. Group Members: Nowak, Stephen. Jimenez, Destinee.
