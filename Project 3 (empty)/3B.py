Project 3B: 
Develop a number guessing game. The program should generate a random number and then 
ask the user to guess the number. Each time the user enters a guess, the program should 
indicate whether it was too high or too low. The game is over when the user correctly guesses 
the number. When the game ends, the program should display the number of guesses the user made. 
Break your program into functions where appropriate.
