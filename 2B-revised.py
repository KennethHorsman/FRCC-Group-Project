""" Again, this generally looks good. I would split the Rental_Cost function up into get_num_dvds, 
get_num_vhs and use a similar flow to 2A. 
Also, as a general rule any time you find yourself returning a tuple (multiple values) from a function 
it's a good sign that you need to break that function up. """
