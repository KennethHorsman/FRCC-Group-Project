"""
Project 2B:

Five Star Retro Video rents VHS tapes and DVDs to the same connoisseurs who like to buy LP record albums. 
The store rents new videos for $3.00 a night, and oldies for $2.00 a night. Write a program that the clerks 
at Five Star Retro Video can use to calculate the total charge for a customer's video rentals. 
The program should prompt the user for the number of each type of video and output the total cost.
