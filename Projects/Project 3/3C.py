"""
Project 3C:
Develop a program that simulates a slot machine. When the program runs, it should do the following:
Ask the user to enter the amount of money they want to insert
Instead of displaying images, the program will randomly select a word from the following list: 
Cherry, Orange, Plums, Bell, Melon, Bar. 
The program will select and display a word from this list three times. 
If none of the randomly selected words match, the program will inform the user that they've won $0. 
If two words match, the program will inform the user that he or she has won two time the amount entered. 
If three words match, the program will inform the user that they've won three times the amount entered.
The program will ask whether the user wants to play again. If so, the steps are repeated. 
If not, the program displays the total amount of money entered into the slot machine and the total amount won.
